This script models an SVM for text classification. 

The dataset I will employ consists of tweets related to Apple Inc., collected from various sources and then 
aggregated [2]. These tweets will serve as the basis for sentiment analysis, where the SVM models will
predict the target classifications (positive, negative, or neutral sentiments) regarding Apple products,
services, or events.
