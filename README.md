# AppleTweets_SVM
This project will encompass the discussion of the book Learning to Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines: Methods, Theory, and Algorithms by Thorsten Joachims (2002) [1] as well as an applied example of text classification using SVMs in Python. For the application of the methods discussed by Joachims the aggregated kaggle dataset "Apple tweets sentiment dataset" will be used [2]. This dataset includes the target variable labels and the explanatory variable tweets. The target variable has three classes negative, neutral, and positive (-1, 0, and 1 respectively), and the explanatory variable is the body of text within a tweet associated with Apple Inc. (determined by hastags). The values in the response variable labels are human labeled sentiments of each of the tweets. For evaluation purposes the dataset will be split into mutually exclusive train and test datasets.

# Goals
The project’s goals are to discuss the methods of text classification through SVMs as well as effectively perform text classification on a real world example. Through this project, I aim to gain practical experience in applying SVMs to real-world text classification problems, particularly in the context of sentiment analysis of Apple Tweets [2]. Additionally, I intend to deepen my understanding of the theoretical foundations behind SVMs and their optimization techniques as discussed in Joachims’ book.

# Methods
This project intends to utilize sections from Thorsten Joachims’ Learning to Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines: Methods, Theory, and Algorithms as the primary resource [1]. This book serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding support vector machines (SVMs), a powerful tool in machine learning for text classification tasks. By leveraging the insights provided in this text, the aim is to enhance my understanding of SVMs and their applications in text classification analysis. The dataset I will employ consists of tweets related to Apple Inc., collected from various sources and then aggregated [2]. These tweets will serve as the basis for sentiment analysis, where the SVM models will predict the target classifications (positive, negative, or neutral sentiments) regarding Apple products, services, or events.

# Project Success
The performance of the SVM models will be evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and error rate ensuring that the SVM models achieve competitive or superior performance in sentiment classification tasks related to Apple tweets [2]. More importantly the success of this project will be the comprehension of the knowledge shared by Joachims’ book [1]. This will be displayed through the project report’s comprehensive discussion on the topic.
